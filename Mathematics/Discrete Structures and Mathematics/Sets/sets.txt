Idea 1: The intro
The concept of a set is basic to all of mathematics and mathemaitcal applications.
A set is a collection of objects or elements/members.
For example (Example 1)
Let A be a set:
A = {1,2,3,4}
A is the name of the set and 1,2,3,4 are the elements/members of the set.
If I were to add ",..." after the 4th element so, it would look like: A = {1,2,3,4,...}
This would be an "infinite set". This means the set does not have any limit or finite length of elements.

Example 2: 
B = {x | x is a positive, even integer}
We are listing the property of the element(s), x, here.
"B = the set of all x such that x is a positive, even integer"

Sets are nothing new to us. I'll put a link here to some common sets we have seen from previous mathematics. May we didn't even know they were called "sets".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_notation
We see "N" for natural numbers, "Z" for integers, etc.

Idea 2: The Cardinality
If we have a set called X, and it is a finite set,
we can get the number of elements of set X,
where | X | = the number of elements.
Example: So if we have a set of 5 elements called X.
(X = {1,2,3,4,5}), then | X | = 5.
This is called the Cardinality of set X
Example: How about the cardinality of an infinite set? Such as the natural numbers, N?
The cardinality of this set would simply just be infinite.

Idea 3: Member notation
If we have a set, X, and call a member x,
Then x belongs to X. We can write this as x ϵ X
Which translates to X = {x}

If we have an element,x, that is NOT a member of X,
then we can denote it as x\notin X (epsilon with slash through it)


If we have a set, X, with no element(s) in it, we denote it
as Ø.

If we have a set X and a set Y that are "equal", we say X = Y


Examples:
Equal Sets: Let X = {1,4,2} and Y = {2,2,1,4}
Although these sets may be in different orders and have different amounts of the same elements, they still consist of the same elements, 
which makes them equivalent.
CHECK*** Equation:
A = {X | x^2 + x - 6 = 0} and B = {2,-3}
A = B here, since if we were to plug in B's elements into the equation in X, we would get a true statement...

Non-equal Sets: X = {1,3,4} and Y = {4,5,7}
X does not equal Y, since there is at least on element in X that is not in Y.

Idea 4: Subsets
Let's say we have 2 sets, X and Y. If every element of X is in Y, then we can say X is s subset of Y.
Example: X = {1,2} and Y = {1,2,3}
Notation:X c Y
Example: X = {x | 3x^2 + x - 2 = 0}
Aka if x is an element of X, then 3x^2 + x - 2 = 0.
Solving for x, you obtain x = -1 and x = 2/3.
therefore you have x is an element of X,'
but if you were to compare it to something like the Z (integers) set,
then x is not an element of Z. Therefore X (the set) is not a subset of Z.

Any set is a set of itself, since a set shares the same elements with itself.
The empty set is a subset of every set.

If we have a set X that is a subset of Y but does not equal Y,
then X is called a proper subset of Y.
Example: X = {3,4} and Y = {1,2,3,4}

Powerset: This is the set of all subsets (proper or not proper) of a set.
Given a set, X, the power set of Xi s denoted P(X).
Let |X| = n. Then |P(X)| = 2^n.
Example: Let X = {a,b,c}
P(X) = {empty_set, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c}}
From the details above, we were told an empty set is always a subset of a set and that a set is a subset of itself.



Idea 5: Operations:
Union: A U B = {x | x element of A or x element of B}
Intersection: A n B = {x element of A and x element of B}
Difference/Relative Complement: A - B = {x | x element of A or x not element of B}
Disjoint: If A n B = empty set

Examples: 
1. If A = {1,3,5} and B = {4,5,6}
then:
A U B = {1,3,4,5,6}
A n B = {5} -- this example is a set with one element btw
A - B = {1,3} -- remove elements that are in A that are in B.
VS.
B - A= {4,6} -- remove elements that are in B that are in A
NOTE: In general, A-B does not equal B-A

Idea 6: Complements
Let U be the universal set and X be the subset of U, the set U-X is called the complement of X, denoted by X-bar(X with a bar on top of it)
Example: Let A = {1,3,5}. Let the universal set be U = {1,2,3,4,5}. Then U-A = A-bar= {2,4}
Example: Let A = {1,3,5}. Let the universal set, U = {1,3,5,7,9}. Then A-bar = {7,9}

Idea 7: Partition:
A partition of a set X is every element in X belongs to exactly one member of S of sets.
X is a set
S is a set of sets
X = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
S = {{1,4,5}, {2,6}, {3}, {7,8}}
S is a partition of X

Idea 8: Cartesian Product
Given sets X and Y, and X x(times/cross) Y the set of all ordered pairs (x,y) where x is a member of X and y is a member of Y.
X x Y is the Cartesian Product of X and Y.
Let set X = {1,2,3} and set Y = {a,b}
X x Y  = {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b), (3,a), (3,b)}
Also, |X x Y| = |X| x |Y|
X x Y does not equal Y x X


The Cartesian Product of a set
R^3 = R x R x R
where R = {[-inf,+inf]}

HOMEWORK 1:

Exercise 1: Let the universe be the set U ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.
Let A = {1, 4, 7, 10}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and C = {2, 4, 6, 8}.
List the elements of each set

– A U B = {1,2,3,4,5,7,10}
– B n C = {2,4}
– A – B = {7,10}
– B – A = {2,3,5}
– Ā = U-A = {2,3,5,6,8,9}
– U – C = {1,3,5,7,9,10}
– Ū = U-U = empty set
– A U empty set = A
– B n empty set = empty set
– A U U = U
– B n U = B
– A n (B U C) = part 1: Let X = (B U C) = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8}then A n X = {1,4}
– complementB n (C − A)  = part1: Let X = (C-A) = {2,6,8}, Let Y = cB = U-B = {6,7,8,9,10}, then Y n X = {6,8}
– (A ⋂ B) − C = part1: Let X = (A n B) = {1,4}, then X - C = {1}
– complement(A n B) U C = part1: Let X = (A n B) = {1,4}, then cX = U-X = {2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10}, then cX U C = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
– (A U B) – (C – B)  = part1: Let X = (A U B) = {1,2,3,4,5,7,10}, let Y = (C-B) = {6,8}, then Z = X-Y = {X}

Exercise 2: Determinate A c incl B
 A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 2, 1}; yes
 A = {1, 2} and B = {x| x^3- 6x^2 +11x=6}
 => x^3 - 6x^2 +11x - 6 = 0 =>
 (x^3 - 3x^2) - (3x^2 + 11x -6) = 0
 x^2(x - 3) - (3x^2 - 11x + 6)= 0
 x^2(x - 3) - (3x^2 - 9x) - (2x + 6) = 0
 x^2(x - 3) - (3x(x - 3) - 2(x - 3)) = 0
 x^2(x - 3) - (x - 3)(3x - 2) = 0
(x - 3)(x^2 - 3x + 2) = 0
(x - 3)(x(x - 2) - 1(x - 2)) = 0
(x - 3)(x - 2)(x - 1) = 0
Roots are 3,2,1 => B = {3,2,1}
A is a subset of B. B has all of the elements that A has and more.

 
 

Exercise 3: Show that A is not a subset of B.
 1. A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2}
 2. A = {1, 2, 3} and B = es
 1. A has more elements than B, so it cannot be a subset of B
 2. A has elements and is not an empty set, so it cannot be a subset of an empty set. 

Exercise 4: Let X = {1, 2} and Y = {a, b, c}. List the element of each seat.
 X × Y = {(1,a),(1,b),(1,c),(2,a),(2,b),(2,c)}
 X × X  = {(1,),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)}
