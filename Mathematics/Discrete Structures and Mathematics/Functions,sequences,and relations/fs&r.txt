Chapter 3: Functions, sequences and, relations
1. Functions:
- A function assigns to each member of a set X exactly one member of a set Y. For example, functions are used to analyze the time needed to execute algorithms.
- Let X and Y be sets. A function "f" from X to Y is a subset of the Cartesian product of X x Y for x member of X
and y member of Y with (x,y) member of f.
Recall the Cartesian product from Chapter 1, sets. Let set X = {1,2,3} and set Y = {a,b}
The Cartesian product, X x Y = {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b), (3,a), (3,b)}
This definition is simply saying the function "f" is a subset of this X x Y Cartesian product.
Recall a subset is simply the idea that if every element in a set called A is in a set called B,
then A must be a subset of B.
- We denote a function f from X to Y as f: X => Y
- The set X is called the domain of f and the set of Y is called the co-domain of f.
Recall the domain  of a function is the set of all inputs. (the function must have defined outputs, so, if you gave your function
an input value and the result of the function gave you something undefined or bad data, this input cannot be a member/element of your domain set.)
ex: you may put any real number as input for a function that squares the input, but only real numbers >= 0 for a function that takes the square root of
the input. (That is if we're dealing with real numbers and not imaginary.... look more into this.) 
Recall the range of a function is the set of all possible outputs. All of the outputs make up the range.
ex: going back to the example with a function that only squares the input, the domain is all real numbers, but the range,
will be the output or f(x) ,if we called the input x, a member of all real numbers such that f(x) >= 0.
Our output cannot be negative, since we are squaring all the inputs, which gives us a positive (0 inclusive) output every time.
If we were to graph it, we would notice its the graph of a parabola. All these possible outputs are the range of the function.



The set {y | (x,y) member of f}
*****Which is a subset of the co-domain Y and we call the range of f.*****

(Recall, a co-domain is the set of all outputs that may possible come out of a function, vs a range where the range is the set of the outputs
that actually come out of the function.)
ANALYZE/WRITE MORE
****X (the valid input) is the domain. OK. Y (the output) is the co-domain, so Y has all the outputs that a subset of X x Y could have, while
X x Y has all of them. But we are using f, a subset, therefore the output of f is a range, which is just a portion of the X x Y cartesian product.
{y | (x,y) member of f}. Each y in this case isn't each member of the co-domain, Y, but rather a member of the subset f. Where the range is all
the y members that are in a pair with an x that are members of the function.




Example 1: Consider X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
f = {(1,a), (2,b), (3,c)}
Diagram:
1 ===============> a
2 ===============> b
3 ===============> c

This is a one to one function as well.

See how f is only a subset of the cardinality of sets X,Y or X x Y?



Example 2:
Let's consider X = {1,2,3,4} and Y = {a,b,c}
f = {(1,a),(2,a),(3,b)}
1 ==============> a
2 ==============/^
3 ============== b


Not a function because element 4 is not assigned to anything.

Example 3: Consider X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
f = {(1,a),(2,b),(3,c),(1,b)}

f is not a function from X = {1,2,3} to Y = {a,b,c} because the element 1 in X is not assigned a unique element in Y.
(1 is assigned to two different values in Y which are a and b)

More example:
Defn: For each element x in the domain X, three is exactly one element y in the codomain Y with (x,y) member of f.
f(x) = y
Example 1: Let's consider X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c} and f be the function defined f(x) = y
f(1) = a
f(2) = b
f(3) = c


Example:
Let's consider X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c} and f be the function defined f(x) = x^2
f(1) = 1
f(-2) = 4
f(0) = 0

Graphing:
Another way to visualize functions is via a graph
The graph of a function has it's domain and and co-domain as subsets of the real numbers and is obtained by plotting the points that correspond
to the elements/members in for.
Domain is contained in the horizontal axis (x) and the co-domain is contained in the vertical axis (y)
Look up the graphing of the function f(x)= x^2 as an example.

Modulus:
Defn: If x is an integer and y is a positive integer, we define x mod y to be the remainder when x is divisible by y.
Ex.1: 6 % 2 = 0, 5 % 1 = 0, 8 % 12 = 8
Ex. 2:
If we have a system that stores and retrieves information,
Say we must store or retrieve the number n, we might take as a first choice for a location n, n % 11. 
The function would be: h(n) = n % 11.

15 % 11 = 4, 558 % 11 = 8, 32 % 11 = 10, 132 % 11 = 0, 102 % 11 = 3, 5 % 11 = 5, 257 % 11 = 6
-----------------------------------------------
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
----------------------------------------------
|132|   |   |102| 15| 5 |257|   |558|   |  32|
----------------------------------------------
This approach is called a hash function that takes a data item to be stored or retrieved and computes the first choice for n location for the item

*You are given the number n, and you are going to compute the first choice location for it by using the function h(n) = n % 11
ex: My data number is 132 and I need to store it in a spot. h(132) = 0, this is the first choice location for 132, so we
are going to store it there. 
*I am assuming we are doing the first choice thing because we need to see if that location is already taken, so say we did the previous
example again but location 0 was taken, we might need to use some other function to find another location for it or a second choice or some
other method to find the next best location to store the data.


Floor and Ceiling
The floor of a number, x, is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
The ceiling of a number, x, is the least integer greater than or equal to x.
Example 1:
floor(8.3) = 8
ceiling(9.1) = 10
floor(-8.7) = -9
ceiling(-11.3) = -11
ceiling(6) = 6
ceiling(-8) = -8
Example 2:
Consider the function f(u) = 80 + 17 * ceiling(u - 1) where 0 <= u <= 13
1.) if u = 3.7: f(3.7) = 80 + 17 * ceiling(2.7)
    f(3.7) = 80 + 17 * (3) = 80 + 51 = 131
2.) if u = 2: f(2) = 80 + 17 * ceiling(1) =  80 + 17*1 = 97
3.) if u = 0: f(0) = 80 + 17 * ceiling(-1) = 80 + 17*(-1) = 80-17 = 63


One-to-one and non-one-to-one function:
Definition: A function is said to be "one-to-one" or "injective"
If for each y member of Y, there is at most one x member of X with f(x) = y
Example: The function f = {(1,b), (3,a), (2,c))}
From set X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c} is one-to-one.
1 ===========> b
2 ===========> c
3 ===========> a

Example 2:
The function f = {(1,a), (2,b), (3,a)}
1 ============> a
2 ============> b
3 ============> a
This IS a function. Function inputs can have the same output. BUT. This function is not one-to-one! Each input is not pointing to a unique in the range.
Again, this function is not one to one since f(1) = a = f(3)


Example 3:
If X is the set of persons who have social security numbers and we assign each person x such that x is a member of the set X their
own social security number, where the function is, SS(x) = ss #. We obtain a one to one function since each distinct person has
a distinct SSN.

Example 4: Consider the function f = {(1,b), (3,a), (2,c)}
Where X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c,d}
This function is one-to-one because each element in X has at most one element in Y.
**Yes, a y in Y is not part of the function, that is ok. As long as every x in X is.

This is also a great example of what the domain, co-domain, and range are again.
The domain is all the x members in X. The co-domain is all the y members in Y
and the range is all the y members such that the y members are members of the function.


Example 5: Consider the function f = {(1,a), (2,b), (3,a)}
Where X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
Not one-to-one since the two elements in X have the same element in Y.

One-to-one
Definition: For a function f from X to Y is one-to-one and equivalent
to: For all x1, x2 a member of X, if f(x1) == f(x2), then x1 = x2.
(f(x1) = f(x2)) =====> (x1 = x2)

Example: WE have to prove that the function f(n) = 2n+1 from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers is one-to-one.
We must show that for all positive integers n1 and n2 if f(n1) == f(n2)
then n1 = n2.
So, suppose that f(n1) = f(n2). Using the definition of f, we can say that
2n+1 = 2n2 + 1
2n1 = 2n2
n1 = n2
Therefore, f is one-to-one.

Not one-to-one
A function f from X to Y is not one-to-one and equivalent to:
For all (x1,x2) members of X, if f(x1) = f(x2), then x1 does not equal x2
(f(x1) = f(x2)) =====> (x1 does not = x2)

Example: We have to prove that the function f(n) = 2^n - n^2 from the set of positive integers to the set of integers that is not one-to-one.
We must provide integers n1 and n2, and n1 does not = n2, such that.
f(n1) = f(n2)
If n1 = 2, f(2) = 2^2 - 2^2 = 0
If n2 = 4, f(4) = 2^4 - 4^2 = 0
We find that, f(2) = f(4), but n1 does not = n2. 
Therefore, f is not one-to-one.

Onto:
Definition: If f is a function from X to Y and the range of f is Y, f is said to be onto Y (or an onto function or a surjective function)
So pretty much the range is everything in the co-domain to be onto...as well as be a function of course.
Example 1: 
Consider f = {(1,c), (2,a), (3,b)}
Where X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
This function is one-to-one and onto
f is one-to-one because each element is X has at least on element in Y.
f is onto because each element in Y has at least one element from X pointing to it.

Example 2:
f = {(1,a), (2,a), (3,b)}
where X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
This function is neither one-to-one or onto.
f is not one-to-one because two elements (1 and 2) in X have the same element in Y (a)
f is not onto Y because there is no arrow pointing to c.

Definition again for onto: A function f from X to Y is onto and equivalent to:
 For all y such that y is a member of Y, there exists x such that x is a member of X such that f(x) = y
 Example: We have to prove that the function f(u) = 1/u^2 from the set X of non-zero real numbers to the set Y of the positive real numbers is onto Y.
 We must show that for every y such that y is a member of Y, there exists a u such that u is a member of X such that f(u) = y
 f(u) = y
 1/u^2 = y
u = + or - 1/sqrt(y)

Notice that 1/sqrt(y) is defined because y is a positive real number. If we take u to be the positive square root: u = 1/sqrt(y)
Thus, for every y such that y is a member of Y, there exists u, namely u = 1/sqrt(y)
such that f(u) = f(1/sqrt(u)) = 1/1/sqrt(y)^2 = y
Therefore, f is onto Y.

Definition again for not-onto:
A function f from X to Y is not onto and equivalent to:
For all y such that Y is a member of Y, there exists x such that x is a member of X such that f(x) does not equal y
So...the function's range does not equal the co-domain...I think.
Example 1: We have to prove that the function f(n) = 2n - 1
from the set X of positive integers to the set Y of positive integers is not onto Y
We must find an element m such that m is a member of Y such that for all n such that n is a member of X, f(n) does not = m
Since f(n) is an odd integer for all n(f(n) = 2n-1), we may choose for y any positive, even integer, for example y = 2. Then y such that y is
a member of Y and f(n) does not = y
Therefore, f is not onto Y




Bijections:
A function f from X to Y that is both one-to-one and onto is called a bijection.
Example 1: The function f = {(1,a), (2,c), (3,b)}
From X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}. This function is both one-to-one and onto from X to Y and f is called a bijection
Example 2: If f is a bijection from a finite set X to a finite set Y, then |X| = |Y|,
that is, the sets have the sets have the same cardinality and are the same size. For example:
f = {(1,a), (2,b), (3,c), (4,d)}
This function is bijection from X = {1,2,3,4} and Y = {a,b,c,d}. Both sets have four elements. In effect, f counts the elements in Y:
This function is bijection from X = {1,2,3,4} and Y = {a,b,c,d}. Both sets have four elements. In effect, f counts the elements in Y:
f(1) = a is the first element in Y
f(2) = b is the second element in Y
f(3) = c is the third element in Y
f(4) = d is the fourth element in Y


Inverse Function:
Definition: A function f from X to Y is called inverse where f is one-to-one and onto, equivalent to: (x,y) such that
(x,y) is a member of f, and denoted f^-1
Example 1: Consider the function f = {(1,a), (2,c), (3,b)} where X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
f^-1 = {(a,1), (c,2), (b,3)}
** So were given a function as above, and this is saying just to give the function in its inverse form.
Example 2: Consider the function f = {(1,b), (2,c), (3,a)} , where X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
So, f^-1 = {(b,1), (c,2), (a,3)}
The inverse is obtained by reversing all of the elements of Y and X.

Composition of Functions:
Definition: Let g be a function from X to Y and f be a function from Y to Z.
The composition of f with g, denoted and f o g, is the function
(f o g)(x) = f (g(x))
from X to Z
Example: Consider the function g = {(1,a), (2,a), (3,c)} from X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c}
and f = {(a,y), (b,x), (c,z)} a function from Y to Z = {x,y,z}

the function f o g = {(1,y), (2,y), (3,z)}


1 ==========>  a _____________> x
2 ==========/^ b/ \___________> y
3 ==========>  c ============ > z

X     g        Y                Z

then

1\__________
            \  x
2 ===========> y
3 ===========> z
X   f o g      Z


EXERCISES ON FUNCTIONS:
Exercise 1a: Find the element of each set, draw the graph and determine if the function is one-to-one, onto, or both. If it is
one-to-one and onto, give the description of the inverse function as a set of ordered pairs, draw a graph and identify the element of each set.
1. S = {(1,a),(2,a), (3,c), (4,b)}
Where the domain X = {1,2,3,4} and the range Y = {a,b,c}
1_____________              
              \->a
2-------------/
                 b<----     
3_______________       |
                \-> c  |
4----------------------
*Fix this graph

Well, not one to one because f(1) and f(2) both have a as the value.
Onto, because each domain value is point to every y value in the range
Cannot do the inverse of this function because it is not one-to-one AND onto.

Exercise 1b:
K = {(1,c), (2,d), (3,a), (4,b)}
where the domain X = {1,2,3,4}
and the range Y = {a,b,c,d}
One-to-one and onto.
Inverse:
K^-1 = {(c,1), (d,2), (a,3), (b,4)}

Exercise 1c:
V = {(1,d), (2,d), (4,a)}
where the domain X = {1,2,4} and the range Y = {a,d}
Not one-to-one, 1 and 2 in X are both pointing to d in Y.
It is onto though, every x value in the domain is point to at least one value in the range of Y

Exercise 2:
Determine whether each function is one-to-one, onto, or both. The domain and co-domain of each function is the set of all integers.
1. f(n) = n+1
X = {0,1,2,3,4...}: Domain
Y = {0,1,2,3,4...}: Co-domain
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 2
f(2) = 3
f(3) = 4
f(4) = 5
The function is both one to one and onto
